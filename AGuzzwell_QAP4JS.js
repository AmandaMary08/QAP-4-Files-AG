// Create a reasonably complicated Object in JavaScript that contains attributes and methods for the Motelcustomer.  The  customer  attributes  should  include  (and  not be limited  to),  the customerâ€™sname, birth date,  gender,  androompreferences  (as  an  array),  payment method, mailing  address  (as  a  sub-object), phone  number, check-in,and  check-out  date  (as  a  sub-object),  and object methods  to  determine theirage  and  duration  of  stay.  The  JavaScript  code  should  also  create  a  template  literal  string,  or  properly formatted html, that describes the customer. In other words, writes a paragraph describing the customer with many of their personal attributes dynamically embedded in the string / html coming from the above object definition.

  //.getTime gets the the elapsed time from January 1, 1988, 00:00:00 UTC. So it gets the time from said date until whats in the checkInDate value. Then you minus eachother in the duration section to give you the time elapsed between those two dates. Math.ceil is a function that returns the smallest integer greater than or equal to a given number. It rounds a number UP to the nearest whole number. It rounds the duration in milisecondsperday / milisecondsperday UP to a whole number.
