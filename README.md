This program is created for One Stop Insurance Company to enter and compute insurance policy details for new customers. It gathers customer information such as name, address, and contact details, as well as policy specifics like the number of insured vehicles, additional coverage options, and payment methods. The program calculates insurance premiums, taxes, and monthly payments based on the provided input. Additionally, it allows users to enter claims information and generates a policy information receipt for each customer. The program saves the computed values along with the user's input information to a .dat file for future reference and storage.
